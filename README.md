# Calcuratio

Simply, I grew tired of manually calculating the aspect ratio of every image or video I had to resize and every single calculator I found online had 2000s design.

Calcuratio allows you to:

- Get the width given the current height and the aspect ratio or
- Get the height given the current width and the aspect ratio or
- Get the aspect ratio given the width and height.
